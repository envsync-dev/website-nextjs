# envsync-dev

Manage your env vars and sync them directly in your project.

Sharing environment variables is always challenging, especially in complex projects with multiple repositories, such as micro-frontends and microservices. Thereâ€™s often a struggle to manage and share environment variables across different environments. Additionally, team members may have variations tailored to specific use cases, such as targeting deployed REST APIs or local ones running in Docker.

That's why I started **EnvSync** an open source webapp and npm package, a simple tool with minimal setup to sync env vars across your projects and teams.

## **Warning**

UI and APIs can and will change without previous notice.

## Host it yourself

This project mainly uses NextJS and Supabase, it is targeted to be deployed in Vercel.

Requirements:

- Supabase account
- Vercel account

## How to use it

### Step #1

Create an account in [envsync-dev](https://envsync-dev.vercel.app/)

### Step #2

Create new project. By doing this it will create a `PROD` env by default

### Step #3

Create env vars in your environment and copy your env-id using the fingerprint button

### Step #4

Go to your project and run:

```shell
npx @ealvarez/envsync init
```

That script will create config file `.envsync`, open it and update `ENVSYNC_PROJECT_ID` with the env-id you previously copied

### Step #5

now run `npx @ealvarez/envsync pull` to pull the contents of your env into our `.env` file
